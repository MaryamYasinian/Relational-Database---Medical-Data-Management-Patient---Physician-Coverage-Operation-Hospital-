# Relational Database Medical Data Management for Patients, Physicians, Coverage plans, Operations, and Hospitals
In this project, I designed a relational database model for a medical setting involving patients, hospitals, physicians, appointments, operations, procedures, and insurance coverage. IMy project demonstrates how to design and map multiple connected datasets using Primary Keys (PK), Foreign Keys (FK), and relational constraints to ensure data consistency, validity, ans integrity of data within multiple datasets.

Entity Relationship Diagrams showing the structure of all tables and their relationships.

# Approach 
- Designed a normalized relational database in which connections between multiple tables have been taken into account when designing the database

- Built clear entity relationship diagrams

- Applied PK/FK constraints

- Modeled one to many and many-to-many relationships

- Created a schema that supports efficient navigation across interconnected tables, allowing users to query, join, and analyze data reliably.
